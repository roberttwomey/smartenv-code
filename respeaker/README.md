## Speech Recognition
The best solution I have found is the [speechrecognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/) package, which uses google speech services by default.

This script will listen to the microphone, recognize anything it hears, and send the result to an mqtt broker. To start the script on the pi use:

To run the script on the pi: 
`python speechrecognition_mqtt.py`

Publishes to `smartenv/audionode/speech`

### Speech Subscriber p5

- speechSubscriber_mqtt: https://editor.p5js.org/robert.twomey/sketches/9rzxlO4Qs
  - (mqtt subscriber that listens for recognized speech)

## Indicator Lights
Use the p5 [mqttPublisher](https://editor.p5js.org/robert.twomey/sketches/CEXVmsCBS) example to control the light ring.

MQTT Topic: `/smartenv/audionode`

Control Messages:
  - `/smartenv/audionode` with value `wake`

  - `/smartenv/audionode` with value `think`
  - `/smartenv/audionode` with value `sleep`
  - `/smartenv/audionode` with value `off`
  - `/smartenv/audionode` with value `color R G B`

Example adapted from [respeaker pixel_ring examples](https://github.com/respeaker/pixel_ring/blob/master/examples/respeaker_4mic_array.py) with some MQTT special sauce.
