## Speech Recognition
The best solution I have found is the [speechrecognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/) package, which uses google speech services by default.

This script will listen to the microphone, recognize with google speech, and stream to an mqtt broker:

`python speechrecognition_mqtt.py`

this script publishes to `smartenv/audionode/speech`

__Speech Subscriber in p5__ 

- speechSubscriber_mqtt: https://editor.p5js.org/robert.twomey/sketches/9rzxlO4Qs
  - (mqtt subscriber that listens for recognized speech)

## Indicator Lights
Use our p5 [mqttPublisher](https://editor.p5js.org/robert.twomey/sketches/CEXVmsCBS) example with the following topic and message:

MQTT Topic: `/smartenv/audionode`

Control Messages:
  - `/smartenv/audionode` with value `wake`
  - `/smartenv/audionode` with value `think`
  - `/smartenv/audionode` with value `sleep`
  - `/smartenv/audionode` with value `off`
  - `/smartenv/audionode` with value `color R G B` NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

Example adapted from [respeaker pixel_ring examples](https://github.com/respeaker/pixel_ring/blob/master/examples/respeaker_4mic_array.py) with some MQTT special sauce.
