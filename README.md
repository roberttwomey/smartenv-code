## RPI as IoT Gatweay
Reads BLE advertising packets to parse accelerometer (and other) data. Transmit these to a mqtt broker (shiftr.io). Runs as a service on the Raspbery Pi.
- see files here [ble/](ble)

## To verify mqtt messaging: 
We are exploring shiftr.io as our mqtt broker. You can view a live visualization of their public broker here: [https://www.shiftr.io/try/](https://www.shiftr.io/try/)

## p5 mqtt examples

These examples explore sending (publishing), receiving (subscribing) and doing other things with the mqtt messages.

__The Better Way (v2)__

### E8 Sensor Tags
Use the G1 Iot gateway to read tags. Work with accelerometer data.
- mqttPublisher_slider: https://editor.p5js.org/robert.twomey/sketches/lkXZ4-Aa8
  - (uses sliders to simluate accelerometers)
- mqttSubscriber_bargraph: https://editor.p5js.org/robert.twomey/sketches/dA6aKcBpu9 
  - (receives data and displays accelerometer as a bar graph)
- mqttSubscriber_teapot: https://editor.p5js.org/robert.twomey/sketches/cA0f-c5y0
  - (receives data and uses accelerometer to rotate teapot)

__Tests__
- mqttPublisher_JSON: https://editor.p5js.org/robert.twomey/sketches/uaCayQRDB
  - (sends a static data packet in JSON format, as it were the G1 gateway)
- mqttSubscriber_G1: https://editor.p5js.org/robert.twomey/sketches/-djHYLWZy
  - (receives data in JSON format from G1 gateway)
